## 🎯 Aspiration

- I enjoy understanding how **mathematical ideas turn into small bits of code** and solve simple problems around us.
- Hoping to explore Maths & Computing more deeply in college and understand how it connects to real systems, data, and logic.
- Use Python for building simple projects based on the topics I study in school — like probability, functions, matrices, and basic modelling.

## 👤 Personal

- Class 12 student who likes maths, coding experiments, and understanding **“why something works”** rather than just the final answer,  
- Played **National-level chess (Under-5)** and ranked #8 then, FIDE ID: **46653147** — chess taught me patience and clear thinking.  
- I also love listening to music and noticing patterns in rhythm, which somehow connects to my interest in maths. Difficult to explain though..😛
- Still learning and improving, and this space is simply: my small record of curiosity and progress.
