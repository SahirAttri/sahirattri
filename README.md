## 🎯 Aspiration

- I enjoy understanding how **mathematical ideas turn into small bits of code** and solve simple problems around us.
- Use Python for building **simple projects** based on my school study, like: probability, functions, matrices & basic modelling.
- Hoping to **explore maths & computing more deeply** in college and understand how it connects to real systems, data, and logic.

## 👤 Personal

- Class 12 student who likes maths, coding experiments, and understanding **“why something works”** rather than just the final answer,  
- Played **National-level chess (Under-5)** and ranked #8 then, FIDE ID: **46653147** — chess taught me patience and clear thinking.  
- I **love music** and notice patterns in rhythm, which connects to my interest in maths. Difficult to explain though..😛
- Still learning and improving, and this space is: **my small record** of curiosity and progress.
